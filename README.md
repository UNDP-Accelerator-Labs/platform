## Getting started

Run all the sql files on the postgres-DB.

Install using: `npm install`
Update the configuration in `config/edit/index.js` if needed.
Create a `.env` file from the `template.env` with the appropriate credentials.

## Run the servers

Run:
```
source .env
npm start
```

And in another tab (to compile sass):
```
npm run sass
```
