Exploration Feature and Data Usage
==

Explorations are a special type of collection that is tightly integrated with browsing the platform.
You can select relevant pads for an exploration, which adds them to the collection.
You can also indicate that a pad is not relevant for an exploration,
which will make the pad translucent when it appears in search results.
This way, you can quickly see which pads might be of interest when doing multiple
queries for building a collection featuring a certain topic.
In the future, we plan to let the exploration description prioritize
relevant pads in your searches. Therefore, it is best to describe what you are
looking for in detail when naming an exploration.

For the above-mentioned suggestion feature, we might collect questions and corresponding documents
for potentially training machine learning models.
When doing so, the data will be anonymized and any connection to a user or account will be removed prior to training.

The goal of the project is to create a language model that can suggest documents
based on questions prompted by a user. As we improve the model, initial suggestions
for the exploration feature will be provided by the latest model.

If you have any questions or concerns feel free to contact the team or open an
