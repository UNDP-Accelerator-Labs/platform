Exploration Feature and Data Usage
==

This is currently an experimental feature!

Explorations are a special kind of collection that is tightly integrated with browsing the platform.
You can select relevant pads for the exploration which adds them to the collection. You can also indicate
that a pad is not relevant for an exploration which will make the pads show transparent when they appear
in search results. This way you can quickly see which pads might be of interest when doing multiple
queries for building a collection featuring a certain topic. In the future we are planning to
let the exploration description prioritize relevant pads in your searches. Therefore, it is best to
verbosely describe what you are looking for when naming an exploration.

For the above mentioned suggestion feature, we collect questions and corresponding documents
for potentially training machine learning models.
The data is anonymized and any connection to a user or account is removed prior to training.

The goal of the project is to create a language model that can suggest documents
based on questions prompted by a user. As we improve the model initial suggestions
for the exploration feature will be provided by the latest model.

If you have any questions or concerns feel free to contact the team or open an [issue](https://github.com/UNDP-Accelerator-Labs/platform/issues).
