Journey Feature and Data Usage
==

We collect questions and corresponding documents for training machine learning models.
The data is anonymized and any connection to a user or account is removed prior to training.

The goal of the project is to create a language model that can suggest documents
based on questions prompted by a user. As we improve the model initial suggestions
for the journey feature will be provided by the latest model.

If you have any questions or concerns feel free to contact the team or open an [issue](https://github.com/UNDP-Accelerator-Labs/platform/issues).
